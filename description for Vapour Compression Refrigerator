This project describes the analysis of vapor compression refrigeration system by using diffuser between compressor and condenser. The refrigerant leaving the diffuser has a higher pressure than refrigerant entering the diffuser. The purpose of a compressor in vapour compression system is to raise the pressures of the refrigerant. In the conventional condenser, there is a pressure drop across the tubes thereby increasing the power consumption of the compressor. This work is aimed at improving the cop of vcr system by introducing a diffuser between the compressor and diffuser. The diffuser is a passive device which increases the pressure of fluid at the cost of fluid velocity without consuming any energy .This project describes the analysis of vapor compression refrigeration system by using diffuser between compressor and condenser.
